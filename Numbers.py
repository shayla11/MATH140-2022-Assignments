# Create an integer between 100 and 200
a = 137

# Create an integer between 10 and 15
b = 13

# Find the quotient when a is divided by b
c = a//b

# Find the remainder when a is divided by b
d = a%b

# Compute b^9
e = b**9

# Computer sqrt(26)/cbrt(11)
f = math.sqrt(26)/(11 ** (1. / 3))

# Compute...
g = (((2-4)**3)-7)/(2*((3+15)**2))




# How many full weeks are there in 2,345,321 days?
h =  2345321//7

# If today is Sunday, what dat of the week will it be in 2,345,321 days?
i = 2345321%7 # 6 =Saturday

# Using the same convention as the previous, if today is Friday, what day 
# of the week will it be in 5,145,361 days?
# sun = 0, mon = 1, tues = 2, wed = 3, thurs = 4, fri = 5, sat = 6
j = 5145361%7 # tuesday




# How many full days are there in 3,213,121,332,134,435,665,756 seconds?
k = 3213121332134435665756//86400

l = 3213121332134435665756%86400 # 78,556 seconds left. almost a full day
